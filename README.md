This is an Grocery list app where we can add ,store,edit
& delete items.
Added item to the store will be stored in the local storage
and will be available and be display in the container until the item or items is delete.

Html is used only to create the static structure
for the app and Css for the designing..

#### localStorage
localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored
in the browser will remain there even after the browser window is closed like data is stored in a database.

* eidt button: to edit the added item from the list item container
   as well  as from the local storage.

   as well  as from the local storage.
